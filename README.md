# connect_dbMySQL
connect Neatbeans to dbMySQL, insert data with sql query by displaying appropriate messages using the Swing library (GUI) and ActionEvent 


-----------------------------------------
In the src folder included the source code: Java Netbeans - connecting to mysql database using Xampp 

Once you have created the JFrame class, you need to right-click on the libraries folder, then Add Libraries and finally download the MySQL JDBC Driver

That's all.
